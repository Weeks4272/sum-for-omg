# Project Summary
The project is a comprehensive web-based bioinformatics analysis platform named **BioinfoAnalyzer**. It offers advanced tools for analyzing DNA and RNA sequences, allowing users to upload sequences or input them directly. The platform performs various analyses, including sequence alignment and similarity checks against multiple databases such as NCBI, Ensembl, dbSNP, ClinVar, RefSeq, UniProt, and OMIM. By providing a modern web interface, BioinfoAnalyzer makes complex bioinformatics tasks accessible and efficient, enhancing the user experience in scientific workflows.

# Project Module Description
The platform includes the following functional modules:
- **Sequence Ingestion**: Upload and input DNA/RNA sequences.
- **Analysis Engine**: Conducts sequence alignment, similarity analysis, and database cross-referencing.
- **Output Generation**: Produces structured reports in JSON, CSV, and text formats.
- **User Interface**: Provides an interactive web interface with real-time analysis and progress indicators.
